v0.0.1
This project uses [TermuxArch](https://github.com/SDRausty/TermuxArch) to install an instance of [Arch Linux ARM](https://archlinuxarm.org/) inside a [PRoot environment](https://proot-me.github.io/) inside of [Termux](https://termux.com/). It then installs and configures Anki, a desktop environment (XFCE4), and a VNC Server (tigervnc). [This page](https://archlinuxarm.org/packages/any/anki) shows version of Anki that this project installs.

Install Requirements:
1. Android 5+ (Android 5/6 users can use Termux 0.75 from F-Droid after enabling the the F-Droid Archive repo)
2. 2.3 GB of internal storage space, not including the size of your Anki collection. This project installs and configures a full Linux distro (Arch Linux ARM) with a desktop environment (XFCE4) and VNC server (TigerVNC) so it can run Anki. If you use AnkiDroid and AnkiTermuxArch you will end up with two copies of your collection on your device. It's not yet possible to have the projects share the same copy of an Anki collection.
3. Time. Depending on your device and internet connection, the install may take a few minutes to an hour.
4. Apps:
    * An VNC client app for connecting to a VNC server. This is an important choice because this is the main app you'll use to interact with Anki's GUI. Open-source options include MultiVNC and androidVNC (both available on F-Droid) but I've found VNC Viewer from the Play Store most usable.
    * Termux
    * Termux:Widget if you want an Android shortcut for starting AnkiTermuxArch instead of typing the command in Termux

Install Instructions:
1. Install Termux from F-Droid or the Play Store
2. Plug your device into a charger, connected to WiFi, and turn off mobile data
3. Copy and paste the following line of code into Termux to get the code for this project
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sudomain/AnkiTermuxArch.git; bash ~/AnkiTermuxArch/setup_AnkiTermuxArch.bash`
4. If you get a prompt that looks like `[rootXX:XXdir]` then you can type `exit` and press enter. Soon this step wont be necessary
5. Start the `startarch-gui` script by putting a Termux shortcut in your Android home screen or typing `bash ~/.shortcuts/startarch-gui`.
6. Open your VNC client app and connect with these settings:
Address: `localhost::5901` i.e. connect to your device (localhost) on port 5901
Password: ankiarch
7. Click/tap the applications menu in the top left -> Education -> Anki 

The default password can be changed by running the `vncpasswd` command as the vncuser. It doesn't really matter because the VNC server is configured to only allow connections from localhost (the same device it's running on)

Auxiliary Apps:
1. Hacker's Keyboard (for a keyboard with arrow keys which is useful when switching fields in Anki)

Uninstall Instructions:
Uninstalling Termux will remove all files associated with this project. If you want to keep Termux because you use it for other things, run this command to remove everything associated with the Arch install:
`bash TermuxArch/setupTermuxArch.bash purge`

Project TODO:
Things needed for this project to share a collection with AnkiDroid:
    1. The default AnkiDroid directory (/storage/emulated/0/AnkiDroid) is like a Anki user profile. AnkiTermuxArch could use this directory as an Anki profile by setting the ANKI_BASE variable to /storage/emulated/0, but this would clutter that directory with Anki files such as addons21, prefs21.db, and crash.log. See if AnkiDroid is willing to change their default directory so that it's within an empty directory e.g. /storage/emulated/0/AnkiDroid/AnkiDroid User 1
    2. AnkiDroid needs to handle the database lock more gracefully. Currently if Anki has the collection open and AnkiDroid is started, both will report a corrupt collection. It's unknown if the collection is actually corrupt as doing a check database in either app will report no issues. I might be wrong about just AnkiDroid needing a change, but I'm basing it on my previous experience of running Anki 2.1 and trying to open the same collection with Anki 2.0. Both versions wont open the collection if the other has it open.
    3. Set the ANKI_ROOT variable in this project's startvnc-server script by default
